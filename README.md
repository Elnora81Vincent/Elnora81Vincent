## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a backend engineer with a focus on optimizing database queries and improving data performance in MySQL and MongoDB. This repository is a collection of projects, tools, and experiments that reflect my ongoing work in building efficient, scalable backend systems.

Working with data is at the heart of what I do. Iâ€™m passionate about writing queries that are not only correct but also fast and resource-efficient. In MySQL, I work with complex joins, indexing strategies, and query profiling to ensure relational data is accessed quickly and reliably. In MongoDB, I focus on schema design, aggregation pipelines, and optimizing read/write operations in document-based systems.

Performance tuning and query optimization are a key part of my learning and development process. I use real-world data scenarios to test indexing techniques, analyze execution plans, and reduce query latency. I'm also exploring best practices for data modeling, whether itâ€™s normalizing tables in SQL or designing flexible, efficient document structures in NoSQL.

This repository includes scripts, sample datasets, benchmark tests, and code snippets that demonstrate various techniques for improving query performance and backend responsiveness. Each project is built with the goal of solving practical problems and sharpening my skills in database management and backend architecture.

If you're also working with MySQL or MongoDB, or simply interested in the backend side of things, feel free to explore the code, share feedback, or collaborate. I'm always looking to learn more and connect with others who are passionate about efficient data handling.

Thanks for visitingâ€”and hereâ€™s to building faster, smarter backends, one optimized query at a time.
